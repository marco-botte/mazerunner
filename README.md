# MazeRunner - Lumon Style

Greetings, Esteemed Colleague.

For your approved MazeRunner experience, ensure that both **Poetry** and **Python** have been installed per protocol.

Then, with great care and reverence:

```bash
make install
make run
```

Once initialized, you will be prompted.

Kindly input a moderately sized digit… and permit the procedure to unfold.

We are so _proud_ of the work you’re about to do.
